# 100_days_of_code

## Day 0
Like all good projects, it requires a little planning and prework.  Today was a little more research into potential projects and getting things setup so I can jump right in.  I also wanted to make the challenge public today to help with accountability.

It's been just under 6 months since I've finished the U of A Bootcamp in Data Analytics and Visualization.  I found that because I don't code for my job that I'm already getting rusty and starting to work harder to remember some simple code.  With that being said, I'm taking on this goal to create a daily routine around coding and to reimplant those concepts.  This is also an opportunity to explore different software and libraries.  Two that I see often see in my job search are Power BI and Looker.  Those two will be purposefully sought out and the rest will be left to the journey.

**GOALS**
* Refine basic ETL and analytical functions using Python.
* Explore and become familiar with Power BI and Looker.

Other considerations: I'll be comepleting this challenge during the holidays so my wife asked me if I'm really going to be coding on Thanksgiving and Christmas Day.  My answer is yes.  That'll likely be a minimum day and I understand the balance of working, parenting and other aspects of life.  While I don't plan on missing any days - life comes up and I'll be following the original creator.  No more than 1 day every two weeks and those days get tacked on to the end.  Since I work later in the day my plan is to code minimum 6-7am each day before the kiddo wakes up.
