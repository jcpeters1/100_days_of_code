# 100_days_of_code

## Day 0
Like all good projects, it requires a little planning and prework.  Today was a little more research into potential projects and getting things setup so I can jump right in.  I also wanted to make the challenge public today to help with accountability.

It's been just under 6 months since I've finished the U of A Bootcamp in Data Analytics and Visualization.  I found that because I don't code for my job that I'm already getting rusty and starting to work harder to remember some simple code.  With that being said, I'm taking on this goal to create a daily routine around coding and to reimplant those concepts.  This is also an opportunity to explore different software and libraries.  Two that I see often see in my job search are Power BI and Looker.  Those two will be purposefully sought out and the rest will be left to the journey.

**GOALS**
* Refine basic ETL and analytical functions using Python.
* Explore and become familiar with Power BI and Looker.

Other considerations: I'll be comepleting this challenge during the holidays so my wife asked me if I'm really going to be coding on Thanksgiving and Christmas Day.  My answer is yes.  That'll likely be a minimum day and I understand the balance of working, parenting and other aspects of life.  While I don't plan on missing any days - life comes up and I'll be following the original creator.  No more than 1 day every two weeks and those days get tacked on to the end.  Since I work later in the day my plan is to code minimum 6-7am each day before the kiddo wakes up.   

## Day 1
To get started I downloaded an election dataset from Kaggle to play around with.  As I was looking at the data I was surprised with how many different people got presidential votes.  We usually hear about the top two (mayyyybbbee three) and that's that.  I started to look at how many counties they were on the ballot and how many votes they recieved.  Mind definitely got working on how we could use data to make minority candidates more visible.

In terms of coding - oh my goodness I'm rusty.  It was almost embarassing the thought that went into very basic things.  All the more reason that I wanted to do this.  Things that I would fly through in a minute or two required me sitting back and thinking about what I wanted to do and even looking back at my old work where I did the same thing. By the end I did feel it coming back and my mind was getting in the groove.  I'm looking forward to seeing how different this is in 10 days and even at 30.

## Day 2
Updated visualizatoin with a linear regression and looked more into the states that offer more than 3 Presidential candidates on the ballot.  Today definitely felt more relaxed than yesterday.  Definitely hopped in quicker today but still back into the swing of things.  With the limited amount of data I'll likely move on from this tomorrow.

## Day 3
Really glad that I'm doing this challenge.  Not only am I getting good coding time in each and every day, I'm able to work through issues that would be more relevent in the workplace.  Today I worked on combining and cleaning about 275 csv files with the knowledge another file would be added each day and would need to be cleaned in the same manner.  Most of my work to date has been smaller in scale and I could get away with doing a few things by hand.  Not having a project deadline has been nice to explore different ways to solve the problem and ultimately make me better.
