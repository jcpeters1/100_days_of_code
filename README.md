# 100_days_of_code

## Day 0
Like all good projects, it requires a little planning and prework.  Today was a little more research into potential projects and getting things setup so I can jump right in.  I also wanted to make the challenge public today to help with accountability.

It's been just under 6 months since I've finished the U of A Bootcamp in Data Analytics and Visualization.  I found that because I don't code for my job that I'm already getting rusty and starting to work harder to remember some simple code.  With that being said, I'm taking on this goal to create a daily routine around coding and to reimplant those concepts.  This is also an opportunity to explore different software and libraries.  Two that I see often see in my job search are Power BI and Looker.  Those two will be purposefully sought out and the rest will be left to the journey.

**GOALS**
* Refine basic ETL and analytical functions using Python.
* Explore and become familiar with Power BI and Looker.

Other considerations: I'll be comepleting this challenge during the holidays so my wife asked me if I'm really going to be coding on Thanksgiving and Christmas Day.  My answer is yes.  That'll likely be a minimum day and I understand the balance of working, parenting and other aspects of life.  While I don't plan on missing any days - life comes up and I'll be following the original creator.  No more than 1 day every two weeks and those days get tacked on to the end.  Since I work later in the day my plan is to code minimum 6-7am each day before the kiddo wakes up.   

## Day 1
To get started I downloaded an election dataset from Kaggle to play around with.  As I was looking at the data I was surprised with how many different people got presidential votes.  We usually hear about the top two (mayyyybbbee three) and that's that.  I started to look at how many counties they were on the ballot and how many votes they recieved.  Mind definitely got working on how we could use data to make minority candidates more visible.

In terms of coding - oh my goodness I'm rusty.  It was almost embarassing the thought that went into very basic things.  All the more reason that I wanted to do this.  Things that I would fly through in a minute or two required me sitting back and thinking about what I wanted to do and even looking back at my old work where I did the same thing. By the end I did feel it coming back and my mind was getting in the groove.  I'm looking forward to seeing how different this is in 10 days and even at 30.

## Day 2
Updated visualizatoin with a linear regression and looked more into the states that offer more than 3 Presidential candidates on the ballot.  Today definitely felt more relaxed than yesterday.  Definitely hopped in quicker today but still back into the swing of things.  With the limited amount of data I'll likely move on from this tomorrow.

## Day 3
Really glad that I'm doing this challenge.  Not only am I getting good coding time in each and every day, I'm able to work through issues that would be more relevent in the workplace.  Today I worked on combining and cleaning about 275 csv files with the knowledge another file would be added each day and would need to be cleaned in the same manner.  Most of my work to date has been smaller in scale and I could get away with doing a few things by hand.  Not having a project deadline has been nice to explore different ways to solve the problem and ultimately make me better.

## Day 4
Continued to clean up data from yesterday.  Running into some issues due to scale as things are taking a long time to run.  My original thought on uploaded to db then querying might be the best bet.  Also had an idea on a local COVID-19 dashboard which would show visualizations specific to a persons area.  So far I see it for states but not as much in cities.

## Day 5
Feel like I'm kind of pinging all over the place with my work. Part of that I feel like it taking what the data gives me.  I started just wanted to clean and work on some files and I've been thinking of a bunch of different ideas as I work.  I've following some of those tangents and abandoned others.  At the end of the day I'm happy about the process and the work that's being done.  I'm not sure what my output is as of this moment but that also wasn't the point of doing this.

Today I read in a couple new CSVs and started cleaning them to compare COVID cases with local mobility data from Google.  I've done this a little in the past but I thoguht it would be interesting to revisit on a local level with more data.  I also need to loop through the data to make a new calculation which is more good practice.  Overall, I'm using those pieces that I wanted hone.

## Day 6
Finished up the loop and visualziations I started yesterday.  Comparing daily counts of new cases to Google mobility data (places like retail people visit and if it is more or less than baseline which is before COVID).  One of the ways we've dealt with this is staying at home.  Just looking to see the representation of new cases versus people getting out to certain types of businesses.  Going to do a couple more tomorrow before breaking them out.  Exploring these types of questions and real life situations is what makes data so fun. 


## Day 7
It's been one week of coding.  Definitely feel like a lot has come back in a short period of time.  Jumped into Tableau today to check out the retail versus new case in Maricopa County.  You can see they definitely have an effect on on another but if it's weak.  Seems like there's a lot of other factors.  It's too bad Google doesn't provide more categories in data.  

## Day 8
Updated and cleaned up the x axis of my plots.  Took some time to look back at some old work and big data using cloud db.  Tempting to want to branch back out of what I set out to do and find more 'exciting' projects.  Gonna stick to hammering the basics of ETL along with Looker and PowerBI.  Tomorrow may be an day to explore one of the new tools!

## Day 9
Worked on some SQL queries today.  Nothing too exciting to write about today, just some solid practice.

## Day 10
Not much for actual coding today.  Looking into some different opensource databases for the COVID data Brandon and I will be putting together.  Spent the morning jotting down and outline for what will need to happen in the code.  Since there are a lot of CSVs and are updated with new ones daily, I'm thinking there's a way through Pandas to make each CSV a table in SQLite and if it already exists to ignore and if not, to append.  Changes the way we would call the data later on so thinking it's important to come up with this outline first before wasting hours to find out that something isn't how we want later on.  Today was filled with interruptions so I'll check back in tomorrow morning to see what I may have missed!

## Day 11
More SQL practice in addition to looking at the map of COVID data from the other day.  Starting to to notice the mental energy this takes in addition to the normal day-to-day activities.  Takes more than one would think!

## Day 12
Continued to look at the COVID data and prepare it to be used.  I'm getting paralysis by analysis I can tell today.  I've went back and forth twice.  While ruling out some other options haven't made alot of progress forward.

## Day 13
Practiced some advanced selects on hacerrank today using SQL.
